# Morty's Website

This is my final project for the "Web Developer" course at Coderhouse.

Live Demo: [Morty Smith Website](https://master--mortysmithcompany.netlify.app/)

## What I Did

- Developed from scratch using HTML and CSS with SASS.
- Integrated `animate.css` for animated effects.
- Later integrated Bootstrap for a fast and responsive menu.

## What I Learned

- Proper use of CSS grid-based layout system.
- When and how to use CSS flexbox layout.
- Responsive techniques, including mobile-first concepts.
- Grid system of Bootstrap.
- Proper use of GitHub.

## Final Notes

- I was qualified as a Top 10 student for this project.
- Despite not being gradeable in the course, I'm not very satisfied with the look and design that I achieved.

Feel free to explore the live demo and provide any feedback or suggestions for improvement!
